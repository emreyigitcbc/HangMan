# Hangman
Simple PHP-JS Hangman Game
[Project status: RUNNING]

This game made with only **PHP, JS, HTML, CSS**.
I used JSON for storing data because why not? :D

I divided the game by 2,
If you want English version, you must download "EN" one.
If you want Turkish version (Turkish chracters fixed), you must download "TR" one.

I added some words and hints to wordlist but you can change it :)

**You can change Max Wrong Count** in **index.php** to 6,7 or 8.

If you find bugs, you can create a new pull request can't you ??

Thanks,
